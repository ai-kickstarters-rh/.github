## What if I don't have Red Hat AI yet? 

No problem! Kickstarters are educational materials even when they aren't
deployed! They include thorough descriptions, architectures and interactive
demos whenever possible. 

While we prioritize examples intended for Red Hat AI, OpenShift, and RHEL, we
often find ourselves contributing directly to open source projects. Some of
these contributions may find their way to our example catalog and can run in
other environments. 


## Will kickstarters run in my environment? Are these maintained? Are they products? 

Answers are *yes*, *yes* and *no*, respectively. 
- New kickstarters must be proven before they can be included.
- Your environment may differ from ours, but we'll clearly outline dependencies
  up front
- AI kickstarters are maintained by their owner
- Red Hat AI SMEs offer guidance as needed
- AI kickstarters are not Red Hat products. They are examples.
- kickstarters are not products and are not covered by Red Hat support 
- Best effort community assistance may be available
